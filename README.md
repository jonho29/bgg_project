<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are a ton of great board game tracking apps/websites/services that essentially provide the same functionalities (and more), but I wanted to take a stab at creating my own.  This project is a web application for searching, viewing, and managing a personal board game collection using data from BGG.  The app allows users to search for board games, view detailed information, and maintain their own game collection via a user-friendly web interface.

#### Main Features:
* Game Search (via BGG API):
    * Users can search for board games by name, which queries the BGG API and desplays matching results.
    * Users can get detailed game info by game ID, including name, image, description, year published, player counts, suggested player counts, categories, and mechanics.
* Game Collection Management:
    * Users can add games to their personal collection, which is stored using a SQL database (via SQLAlchemy).
    * The collection view displays detailed information for each stored game, such as player counts, suggested numbers, categories, and mechanics.
    * Games can be deleted from the collection through the UI.
* Web UI:
    * The web interface includes pages for searching games, viewing search results, viewing the collection, and detailed views for individual games.
    * Templates are rendered using Jinja2, and static assets (like JavaScript) enable dynamic interactions (such as deleting games).

> **Note:**
> This will be an ongoing project that will continue to evolve as I practice and expand my coding skills.  Expect updates and new features as I experiment with different programming techniques, frameworks, and modern development best practices.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

To avoid downloading the project dependencies locally, download Docker before proceeding with the following steps.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

### Running the App (with Docker Compose)

_Below is an example of how to get the application up and running locally (with Docker Compose)._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jonho29/bgg_project.git
   ```
2. Build and run application
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
3. Open up a web browser and go to `https://localhost:4000/`

### Running the App (with Docker)

_Below is an example of how to get the application up and running locally (with Docker)._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jonho29/bgg_project.git
   ```
2. Build the Docker image
   ```sh
   docker build . -t bgg_project
   ```
3. Run the Docker image
   ```sh
   docker run -p 4000:4000 bgg_project:latest
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

* User visits the home page and searches for a game.
* The app queries BGG, parses the XML, and shows a table of found games.
* Clicking a game shows more details and allows the user to add it to their collection.
* The collection page lists all saved games with detailed attributes, and users can remove games as needed.

> **TODO:**
> Get screenshots and stuff of how to use the website.
